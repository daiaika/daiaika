### ⚡ The Ultimate Developer Experience  
Welcome to the **#1 developer platform in the world** — a fast, modern, and intelligent workspace designed to make development feel effortless.  
Now fully supporting **Python** and built with a **next-gen developer UI** that goes beyond the basics.

## 🧠 Why This UI Stands Out

- ✨ **Modern UI Design**  
  Clean, minimal, distraction-free interface that helps you focus on what matters: writing great code.

- 🚀 **Performance First**  
  Lightning-fast interface built with Vite + React, optimized for speed at every level.

- 🧩 **Modular & Extensible**  
  Add plugins, customize themes, and configure your environment exactly how you want it.

- 🌙 **Dark Mode by Default**  
  Because you deserve beauty *and* comfort.

- 🎯 **Zero Bloat**  
  Every feature is purposeful. No clutter. No gimmicks.
